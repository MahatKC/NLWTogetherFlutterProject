Flutter project developed during 2021's Rocketseat's Next Level Week Together.

The project built is a mobile app that allows users to better manage their personal finances, registering new bills and bills paid. Registration of new bills might be done using Google's Machine Learning API which identifies codebars from bills and stores their information in the app.
